## Docker API and Mongo

This command will lauch a docker image with mongo and the api server to test locally
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

To check the logs for the api response
```bash
$ docker logs -f api
```

To kill docker instances
```bash
$ docker kill api
$ docker kill mongo-express
$ docker kill mongo
```

### Node.js API without Mongo

Raise de development instance with
```
$ npm start
```

When you commit your code, automaticly fix it any linter problems.
If you wish to check them just run `npm run lint`
If you wish to auto fix them just `npm run lint:fix`
If you wish to modify the code, fork this repo and replace the api endpoints,
and don't forget to star it ;>

And then just hit the endpoint to the port 3000 as is the default setted in code,
or the alternative is to set the `PORT` in the environment vars

## Endpoints

| DELETE | http://localhost:3000/colaborator/1 | Delete data by id |

### Mongo Dashboard (when using docker image)

Open your browser at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

## Troubleshooting

If you have mongo connection timeouts or issues, just re run the image
```bash
$ docker-compose restart api
```
